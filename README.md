Honey Express
My project is an android application using Java language in android studio.
It's a honey business app, where you can buy honey.
The app has a bee icon. When you click on it, the app opens up as a fullscreen activity with HoneyExpress written in the center.
If you touch the screen, two buttons will become visible at the bottom: Our Products and Information.
Our Products - scrollview layout - linear layout
Opens up from main fullscreen activity when you click the button. You can see a textview of the description of acacia honey plus a photo under it.
If you scroll down you can see a textview of polyflora honey description and photo.
Information - relative layout
Opens up from main fullscreen activity when you click on it. It is the page where you can actually order the honey. You can choose from 4 different types in a spinner.
Next you input your details(quantity of product, name, contact info, address, special request) and press Place order button. When you press it, an email with your details
will be sent to my email address.
Every activity has an action bar back button.
